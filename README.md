# PLSC-4782

This repository houses course materials from when I taught PLSC 4782 in Spring 2022. This course was transformed from a fully online asynchronous course to a hybrid model as in-person instruction was returning to OSU. I am leaning on materials from all of the previous instructors of this course.
